## Conclusion
Initially, I held the belief that unit-tests were entirely futile. However, as I continued writing tests, it became increasingly evident that they offer a remarkably convenient approach to develop software and ensure its functionality. I must admit that while writing tests can be tedious, they are an essential component for any project, even small ones.
